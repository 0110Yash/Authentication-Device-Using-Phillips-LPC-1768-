ABSTRACT
This project proposes the development of an embedded system leveraging the 
Philips LPC1768 microcontroller kit, FRC cables, and jumper cables to create a 
Tiled Password and Authenticator Manager. The primary objective is to design a 
secure and efficient system for managing passwords and authentication through 
innovative tiled interface mechanisms.
The LPC1768 microcontroller will serve as the core processing unit, handling the 
logic and interface between the user and the authentication modules. FRC cables 
and jumper cables will be utilized for interconnecting components, enabling 
seamless communication and power supply across the system.
Aims:
1. Tiled Interface Development: Implement a tiled interface that allows users 
to securely input and manage passwords. The tiled mechanism aims to 
provide an intuitive and visually appealing interaction method, enhancing 
user experience while ensuring robust security measures.
2. Advanced Security Implementation: Employ advanced encryption 
algorithms and security protocols to safeguard stored passwords and user 
data. Explore multiple authentication methods, potentially integrating 
biometric or two-factor authentication, to enhance overall system security.
3. Versatile Application: Develop a flexible system suitable for various 
applications, ranging from personal security to industrial access control 
systems. The system's adaptability and modularity will be emphasized, 
enabling integration into diverse environments while maintaining efficient 
resource utilization.
The project aims to showcase the LPC1768 microcontroller's capabilities in 
conjunction with FRC and jumper cables, creating a secure, adaptable, and usercentric Password and Authenticator Manager system. The innovative tiled interface 
design, coupled with robust security measures, aims to redefine password 
management and authentication in embedded systems.
